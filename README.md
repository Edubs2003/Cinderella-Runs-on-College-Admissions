# Cinderella-Runs-on-College-Admissions
Our study aims to elucidate the effects of NCAA Cinderella runs on the academic metrics of participating institutions, focusing on changes in SAT scores and admission rates in the years subsequent to the tournament. We hypothesize that unexpected sports success may enhance institutional visibility, potentially attracting a more academically prepared applicant pool. To capture these effects, we develop a series of piecewise regression models that quantify both the immediate and delayed academic impacts of Cinderella runs.

In our analytical approach, we employ an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) piecewise regression to examine the linear relationships between our predictors and outcomes. This method is particularly suitable given the potential nonlinear relationships suggested by the variable distributions and is aimed at isolating the specific impact of athletic achievements on academic outcomes.

The empirical models are specified to account for both immediate and more prolonged academic impacts. Model 1 focuses on the immediate academic impact by predicting SAT scores in the first academic year following a tournament, which reflects admissions decisions made prior to knowing the tournament outcomes. The regression equation for Model 1 is:
SAT_Score_{t+1} = β₀ + β₁ Participationₜ + β₂ Cinderella_₀ₜ + β₃ Cinderella_₁ₜ + β₄ Cinderella_2+ₜ + β₅ Typeₜ + β₆ EnrollmentSize_{t-1} + β₇ TimeTrendₜ + εₜ .
Model 2 extends this framework by assessing SAT scores two years post-tournament, capturing any delayed effects of the Cinderella run that might manifest after the immediate post-tournament academic cycle.

Similarly, Model 3 examines the immediate impact on admission rates for the first year following the tournament, using a similar regression structure to Model 1 but with admission rates as the dependent variable. The equation for Model 3 is:
Admission_Rate_{t+1} = β₀ + β₁ Participationₜ + β₂ Cinderella_₀ₜ + β₃ Cinderella_₁ₜ + β₄ Cinderella_2+ₜ + β₅ Typeₜ + β₆ EnrollmentSize_{t-1} + β₇ TimeTrendₜ + εₜ .
Model 4 builds upon Model 3 by analyzing admission rates two years post-tournament, enabling an exploration of more extended impacts.

In addition to these primary explanatory variables, which include participation status and the intensity of Cinderella runs categorized by dummy variables, our models also incorporate controls for institution type (public or private), the size of the student body in the year preceding the tournament, and a linear trend to adjust for overarching temporal patterns in SAT scores or admission rates. Additional controls account for differences between public and private institutions and include historical performance metrics to adjust for existing academic trends that could confound the Cinderella effect.

Our dataset is complete with no missing entries for any key variables, simplifying the analysis by eliminating the need for imputation or data augmentation strategies. This ensures the robustness and reliability of our regression outcomes. Each model is fitted using robust standard errors to address potential heteroscedasticity, ensuring that our inferences remain valid under the assumption of non-constant variance across observations. The regression coefficients from these models will be interpreted as the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the predictor, holding all other factors constant.

This comprehensive methodological approach allows us to isolate the specific impacts of Cinderella runs from other concurrent changes at the institutional level, providing a clear picture of how such unexpected successes in sports can translate into academic advantages. By leveraging this robust analytical framework, we aim to contribute nuanced insights into the strategic benefits of athletic achievements for academic institutions.
